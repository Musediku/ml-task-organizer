# ML-Powered Task Organizer

## Problem Statement
Managing multiple tasks can be overwhelming, especially when tasks have varying deadlines, priorities, and completion times. Users often struggle to:
- Track completed tasks
- Estimate how long tasks will take
- Decide which tasks to prioritize
- Maintain an organized schedule without manual effort

This project builds an intelligent system that **predicts task priority, estimates completion time, tracks progress, and provides personalized recommendations**, helping users organize and complete tasks efficiently.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, the system will:
1. **Predict Task Priority** – Automatically classify tasks as High, Medium, or Low priority based on task details and user history.
2. **Estimate Completion Time** – Provide realistic time estimates for each task.
3. **Track Task Completion** – Monitor completed vs pending tasks and visualize progress.
4. **Provide Personalized Recommendations** – Suggest which tasks to focus on next or batch similar tasks for efficiency.
5. **Dashboard Interface** – Allow users to view tasks, predictions, and recommendations interactively.

## MVP Features
- Task input (description, deadline, estimated duration)
- ML models for priority classification and completion time prediction
- Task tracking and progress visualization
- Personalized recommendations for next tasks
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

## User Interaction
Users interact with the system via a **web-based dashboard**:
- Enter task details through a form (description, deadline, estimated duration)
- View predicted priority and estimated completion time instantly
- Track completed vs pending tasks
- See visualizations of task progress over time
- Get recommendations for the next tasks to focus on

## Mini Roadmap (2 Weeks)
- **Week 1:**
  - Day 1–2: Problem definition & data preparation
  - Day 3–4: Feature engineering & exploratory data analysis
  - Day 5–7: Build and evaluate ML models (priority & completion time)
- **Week 2:**
  - Day 8–10: Dashboard setup & visualizations
  - Day 11–12: Recommendation system & personalization
  - Day 13–14: Testing, polishing, and deployment
